# FireFly Samples

This repository contains sample applications built on top of [FireFly](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly).

The simplest examples to start with are [private-data-transfer-cli](private-data-transfer-cli), which
implements a basic CLI workflow, and [private-data-transfer-ui](private-data-transfer-ui), which
implements the same flow in a React frontend app.

There is also a simple token minting example [mint-token-ui](mint-token-ui), which shows how a browser-based application
can mint tokens on a blockchain and query the token's current balance, and optionally observe those transactions using the [mint-token-cli](mint-token-cli).
