# FireFly Samples

This is the original samples repo created for FireFly, and has since been superseded.

Check out the new stuff here:

- **FireFly Sandbox** - https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-sandbox
  - Runs by default when you start up your stack with the FireFly CLI
  - Contains exercisers for a host of FireFly capabilities functions
  - Shows you snippets of the code you need on-the-glass
- **FireFly SDK** - check it out at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperledger/firefly-sdk
  - Convenient Node.js code wrappers for the FireFly APIs
  - Full TypeScript type definitions for FireFly API input/outputs
  - Event listener support, with all the best practices for reliable processing of events

### Still interested in this repo...

This repository contains sample applications built on top of [FireFly](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly).

The simplest examples to start with are [private-data-transfer-cli](private-data-transfer-cli), which
implements a basic CLI workflow, and [private-data-transfer-ui](private-data-transfer-ui), which
implements the same flow in a React frontend app.
